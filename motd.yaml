text: "I04 is a versatile microfocus macromolecular crystallography beamline. The beam is fully tuneable in the energy range 6-20 keV and can be focused down to 10 × 5 µm². This beamline is equipped with an Eiger2 XE 16M detector, which enables fast and reliable data collection. The recent introduction of dose-driven data collection capabilities prevents the risk of radiation damage on the samples. Data collection can be performed onsite, remotely (through NoMachine), and in a fully automated mode (UDC)"
